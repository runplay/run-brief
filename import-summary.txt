ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* oldlibs/
* oldlibs/EWSJavaAPI_1.2.jar
* oldlibs/additionnal.jar
* oldlibs/commons-logging-1.1.jar
* oldlibs/geocoder-2.9.jar
* oldlibs/log4j-1.2.16.jar
* oldlibs/org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient_4.3.1.jar
* oldlibs/stax-api-1.0.1.jar
* oldlibs/woodstox-core-asl-4.2.0.jar
* proguard/
* proguard/dump.txt
* proguard/mapping.txt
* proguard/seeds.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/activation.jar => app/libs/activation.jar
* libs/additionnal.jar => app/libs/additionnal.jar
* libs/android-support-v13.jar => app/libs/android-support-v13.jar
* libs/libphonenumber-5.8.jar => app/libs/libphonenumber-5.8.jar
* libs/mail.jar => app/libs/mail.jar
* libs/twitter4j.jar => app/libs/twitter4j.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* proguard.cfg => app/proguard.cfg
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
